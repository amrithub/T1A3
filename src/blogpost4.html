                            The Internet had already been known internationally until the early 1990s, and its operation had been largely transferred from the NSF to commercial providers. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the analogue telephone network and the availability of modems for connecting computers to this network, public Internet access has expanded rapidly. With the introduction of optical fibre, electronic communication became available throughout the telephone network, and telephone companies leased their virtual broadband facilities to link routers and regional networks through computer network developers. All Internet marketing restrictions were lifted in April 1995. Although still primarily used by academics and businesses, the Internet was growing, with the number of hosts reaching 250,000. Then the invention of the Web catapulted the Internet to mass popularity almost overnight.</p>
