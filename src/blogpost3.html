                            Ruby programming language is purely Object-Oriented. It was developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid-1990s in Japan.
    
                                The main aim behind Rubyâ€™s development was to make it act as a sensible buffer between human programmers and the underlying computing machinery. Its syntax is similar to many programming languages like C and Java so the C and Java programmers are able to easily learn this language. This language supports all the platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linux.
                                
                                It is based on many other languages like Perl, Lisp, Smalltalk, Eiffel, and Ada. Ruby is an interpreted scripting language. It means most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The programmers working on Ruby also have access to the powerful RubyGems.</p>
