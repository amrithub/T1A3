                            Let’s start by taking a look at some benefits writing clean code has. One of the main benefits is that clean code helps us minimize the time we need to spend reading and trying to understand the code. Messy code has the uncanny ability to slow down any developer and make his work much harder. The messier the code is, the more time developer needs to understand it enough he can work with. And, if the code is too messy, developer may decide to stop and start from scratch.</p>

                            The clean energy industry is booming. The business of renewable power sources is rapidly spreading across the United States as this revolution goes global. For example, Saudi Arabia just announced plans to spend $50 billion in solar and wind projects throughout the country. Additionally, Dutch electric trains are now 100% powered by wind energy. Last year, for the first time in history, clean solar power became cheaper than fossil fuels. These many examples are just a taste of what’s to come in 2017.</p>

                      <p>Advantages of Ruby Programing: </br></br>
                        Ruby programming language is purely Object-Oriented. It was developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid-1990s in Japan.

                            The main aim behind Ruby’s development was to make it act as a sensible buffer between human programmers and the underlying computing machinery. Its syntax is similar to many programming languages like C and Java so the C and Java programmers are able to easily learn this language. This language supports all the platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linux.
                            
                            It is based on many other languages like Perl, Lisp, Smalltalk, Eiffel, and Ada. Ruby is an interpreted scripting language. It means most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The programmers working on Ruby also have access to the powerful RubyGems.</p>

                      <p>Emergence of the Web(1990 to the Present):</br></br>
                            The Internet had already been known internationally until the early 1990s, and its operation had been largely transferred from the NSF to commercial providers. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the analogue telephone network and the availability of modems for connecting computers to this network, public Internet access has expanded rapidly. With the introduction of optical fibre, electronic communication became available throughout the telephone network, and telephone companies leased their virtual broadband facilities to link routers and regional networks through computer network developers. All Internet marketing restrictions were lifted in April 1995. Although still primarily used by academics and businesses, the Internet was growing, with the number of hosts reaching 250,000. Then the invention of the Web catapulted the Internet to mass popularity almost overnight.</p>

                          <p>Advantages of Java programming language:</br>

                                1. Java is a High-level language with simple syntax and a mild learning curve.</br>
                                2. Java is ideal and Standard for enterprise computing.</br>
                                3. Less security rsiks compared to other programming languages, i.e provides more  security.</br>
                                4. Platform-independent and compatible.</br>
                                5. Being one of the most older language, senior programmers prefer it.</br>
                                
                                Disadvantages of Java programming language:</br>
                                1. Java is Slow. Java is comparatively slower than other popular programming languages.</br>
                                2. More Memory Space required by Java compared to other programming languages3. Java is memory-consuming and significantly slower than natively compiled languages such as C or C++.</br>
                                3. The default look of GUI applications  in Java using the Swing toolkit is very different from native applications.</br>
                                Language Limited Latency Critical Tuning.</br>
                                3. Java has  inefficient Architecture.
